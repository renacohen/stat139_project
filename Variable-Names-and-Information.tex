\maketitle

As the number of COVID-19 cases soars to unprecedented heights around
the United States, public health experts and many political figures
continue to emphasize mask wearing as one of the most effective ways to
slow the spread of the pandemic. But, as a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html}{New
York Times survey} from July 2020 shows, mask wearing adherence varies
widely in counties around the nation. What predictors might explain this
variation in mask wearing, and how might public health officials use
this information to develop more effective mask-wearing interventions?
To what extent can mask wearing predict the spread of the virus on a
county level?

To address these questions, we plan to create two models: one to predict
mask-wearing adherence by county based on a variety of county and
state-wide predictors, and one to predict the spread of coronavirus in a
county based on mask-wearing. Our data about mask-wearing (which is our
outcome in the first model and a predictor in the second model) is from
the aforementioned \emph{New York Times} survey, which was conducted by
the survey firm Dynata on behalf of the Times from July 2 to July 14.
Aggregated at the county level, it sorts 250,000 individual responses
into 3,000 U.S. counties (suggesting that a mixed effects model will
likely be a useful approach). The survey asked respondents how often
they wore a mask (choices were always, frequently, sometimes, rarely, or
never) and presents the percentage of people who gave each answer for
every county, which we combined into a single weighted average
representing the probability that a randomly selected person is wearing
a mask in the county.

Our predictor variables were compiled from a variety of sources and
joined with the mask wearing data by county FIPS code. We included
gender, political party, education, and age statistics at the county
level as all of these demographics have shown to differ in mask wearing
frequency in
\href{https://news.gallup.com/poll/315590/americans-face-mask-usage-varies-greatly-demographics.aspx}{prior
surveys}, with political party being especially significant. Other data,
such as this poll from the
\href{https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/23/most-americans-say-they-regularly-wore-a-mask-in-stores-in-the-past-month-fewer-see-others-doing-it/}{Pew
Research Center} have suggested that mask wearing varies by race: this,
combined with the fact that the pandemic has disproportionately impacted
communities of color according to the
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6933e1.htm}{CDC}
motivated us to include variables about the racial composition of
counties in our baseline model. Researchers at the
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7561164/}{National
Institute of Health} have suggested that age and location (i.e.~rural
vs.~urban setting) likewise affect mask wearing behavior, so we included
the percentage of seniors in a county (since COVID-19 most severely
affects the elderly) and various measures of population density in our
mask-wearing model. Finally, we wanted to look beyond county
demographics and determine whether coronavirus-related measures,
including number of cases/deaths, growth rate of the virus at the time
of the survey, and local/statewide mask mandates explained any of the
variation in mask wearing by county.

For a complete list of the variables in our clean and compiled dataset
and their sources, see the table below.
