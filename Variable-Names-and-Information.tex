\title{Variables and Data Description}

\maketitle

Points to hit:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Our y variable comes from a NYT survey -explain how/where survey was
  conducted, how we came up with our aggregate variable, possible
  problems with it
\item
  Our x variables were compiled from a variety of sources, based both on
  what we easily had access to at the count y level and what prior
  research has shown about how different factors impact mask mandates
  -This Gallup poll showed different mask usage by gender, political
  party, education, and age, so those are all included in our analysis
  (\url{https://news.gallup.com/poll/315590/americans-face-mask-usage-varies-greatly-demographics.aspx}).
